## Introduction

  <p>This project is built using the DE-10 Standard Development kit! The board itself has several components that can be used to develop a variety of projects. Along with all the bells and whistles the DE-10 Standard has Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that allow a developer to quickly on and off load digital circuits that can are created using Verilog and VHDL programming languages.
