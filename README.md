## Introduction

  <p>This project is built using the DE-10 Standard Development kit! The board itself has several components that can be used to develop a variety of projects. Along with all the bells and whistles the DE-10 Standard has Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that allow a developer to quickly on and off load digital circuits that can are created using Verilog and VHDL programming languages. The purpose of this project was explore the world of embedded systems in order to better understand what code is doing at the bare metal level as well as introduce myself to FPGA technology.
